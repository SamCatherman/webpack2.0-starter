I wanted to learn to configure a webpack environment from scratch. Following a tutorial from Indrek Lasn (https://codeburst.io/easy-guide-for-webpack-2-0-from-scratch-fe508a3ce44e).

notes and thoughts:

At its most basic level, aside from installing a few dependencies webpack seems incredibly simple to get started. I plan on exploring more of the features like hot reloading and SCSS compilation.
